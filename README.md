# RC turret control system

## Controlled an aiming system and trigger via an RC controller

### What and why?

As part of a school project we were tasked with designing a toy of our chosing. My responsabilty in this group project was creating a remotely controlled gun for both aiming and shooting using minimal equipment to minimize costs. For this project there are 3 main control points: pan, tilt and the trigger.

### How?
For this project the main motor available was servo motors. To pan a turret inspired system was used. This would allow for a simpler layout and minimize the pressure on the servo motor as the force is spreaded out. For the tilt, a (toy) gun that was light was chosen, therefor the gun was simply cooked directly to the second servo horn sitting on the turret system. Finally for the trigger an inelastic string was connected to the trigger and horn. Connecting the string as close to the center of the servo while allowing sufficient travel to minimize trigger force required. 


### Result:

A system that can be controlled via a radio controller and reciever allowing for easy programming via an arduino.
